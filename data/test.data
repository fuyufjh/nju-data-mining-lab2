The Watchdog service itself is a task running as an idle task hook and services the watchdog on behalf of all the tasks that are registered with our driver.The driver would reset the system if any of the registered tasks do not perform as they should.This is a student Project, a team of 5, There are some corner cases here and there which would be eliminated gradually.#$#Embedded systems,Hardware Drivers,Libraries,

Consequently, it is likely that manual reformatting will be needed.Translation of bibliographies is pretty good and a wide range of styles are handled, but you must typeset your LaTeX file to create the needed .aux and .bbl files first.Translation of equations used to be excellent: it used to be possible to double-click equations in Word and then edit with MathType.  Unfortunately, this conversion in Word has gotten progressively worse over the years (I changed nothing!).

An RPM package is coming soon.This started out as a project to allow ID3 tag management with features I did not find in the run of the mill player/managers out there for MP3 music. It has the ability to set and change album art as well as load devices with exactly the number and size of files to fit in a known file system size. Like for devices. It is up and working and what I feel is intuitive but it could use some sprucing up with nice graphics and maybe more functions. My goal here was to start something and see it grow. And most importantly pay it forward for all the open source that I have benefited from.It makes use of some other open source libraries like JAudioTagger and JAudioLayer. Without which this would not have been possible for me to start.#$#Cataloguing,Editors,Players,

The Java source code from Ekit has been converted in about 14 different programming languages: C++, C#, Delphi, IDL, Ada95, Perl, Python, Ruby, VB, XMLSchema... This way, many student may learn the differences between various programming languages.This project is just for fun.The author, the italian philosopher Luigi Usai, did it as a kind of exercice.

QUAST computes a number of well-known metrics, including contig accuracy, number of genes discovered, N50, and others, as well as introducing new ones, like NA50 (see details in the paper andin the manual). A comprehensive analysis results in summary tables (in plain text, tab-separated and LaTeX formats) and colorful plots. The tool also produces web-based reports condensing all information in one easy to navigate file. QUAST has an intuitive command-line interface and a detailed manual to help users run it and understand its output. Furthermore, the Lab started a Beta version of web-QUAST at http://quast.bioinf.spbau.ru/ which makes quality evaluation even more simple.QUAST paper is available at Bioinformatics Advance Access http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/btt086?ijkey=Kzq9lhMayiqecq9&keytype=ref#$#Bio-Informatics,Test and Measurement,Visualization,
